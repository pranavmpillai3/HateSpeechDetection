Hate Speech Detection with LSTM Model
Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of a Hate Speech Detection system utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is trained on a dataset comprising 50,000 samples to effectively identify instances of hate speech in textual data.

Key Features:
LSTM Architecture: The core of the Hate Speech Detection system is built upon LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Dataset: The model is trained on a diverse dataset consisting of 50,000 samples, encompassing a wide range of linguistic patterns and expressions associated with hate speech.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Leveraging NLP techniques, the system preprocesses and analyzes textual data, extracting relevant features to enhance the model's understanding of language nuances.

Real-time Prediction: The trained LSTM model is capable of making real-time predictions, providing swift identification of hate speech instances in various contexts, including online conversations and social media.
